# caffeine-buildup
A revival of an old script I wrote in grad school

Since caffeine has a surprisingly large half life of ~5 hours, your body
can't excrete all the caffeine you drink in 24 hours.  This script attempts
to show how many days it takes to reach a fixed "baseline" level of caffeine
if you are a regular drinker.
